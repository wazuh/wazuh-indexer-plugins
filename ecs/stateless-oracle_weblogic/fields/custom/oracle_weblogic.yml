  description: oracle_weblogic custom fields for WCS integration
  fields:
  - name: oracle.weblogic.subsystem
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: The WebLogic subsystem that generated the log message. Examples include
      Security, JTA (Java Transaction API), JDBC, JMS, EJB, HTTP, etc. This helps
      categorize log entries by functional area within the WebLogic server.
    example: example-subsystem
  - name: oracle.weblogic.machine_name
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: The name of the physical or virtual machine where the WebLogic server
      instance is running. This is useful in clustered environments to identify which
      node generated the log entry.
    example: example-machine_name
  - name: oracle.weblogic.server_name
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: The name of the WebLogic server instance that generated the log message.
      In a WebLogic domain, this could be an Admin Server or a Managed Server name
      (e.g., AdminServer, ManagedServer1, etc.).
    example: example-server_name
  - name: oracle.weblogic.thread_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: The identifier of the thread that generated the log message. WebLogic
      uses thread pools to handle requests, and this field helps track which thread
      was responsible for the logged operation.
    example: example-thread_id
  - name: oracle.weblogic.diagnostic_context_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: A unique identifier used for correlating related log messages across
      different components and subsystems within a single request or transaction flow.
      This is essential for distributed tracing and debugging.
    example: example-diagnostic_context_id
  - name: oracle.weblogic.meta
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: Additional metadata or context information associated with the log
      entry. This may contain supplementary details about the logged event or operation.
    example: example-meta
  - name: oracle.weblogic.message_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: A unique identifier for the specific type of message or event being
      logged. WebLogic uses it to categorize different types of entries.
    example: example-message_id
  - name: oracle.weblogic.transaction_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    description: The identifier of the transaction associated with the log entry.
      In WebLogic, this helps track operations that span multiple components or services
      within a single business transaction.
    example: example-transaction_id
