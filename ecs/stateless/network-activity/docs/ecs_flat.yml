      that the event is a network connection event sent at the end of a connection
      that also includes a protocol detail breakdown). Note that events that only

    On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object.
    A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks
    may exist.

    On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
    data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
    by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
    of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
    is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate
    `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The full path,
    `file.path`, will include the fork name.'

    On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object.
    A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks
    may exist.

    On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
    data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
    by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
    of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
    is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate
    `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The full path,
    `file.path`, will include the fork name.'

    On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object.
    A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks
    may exist.

    On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default
    data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used
    by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically
    of the form: `C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name`, and `some_fork_name`
    is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate
    `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The full path,
    `file.path`, will include the fork name.'
