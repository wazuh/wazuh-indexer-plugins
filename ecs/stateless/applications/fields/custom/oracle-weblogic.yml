  fields:
  - name: oracle.weblogic.subsystem
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      WebLogic subsystem that generated the log (Security, JTA, JDBC, JMS, EJB, HTTP).
      Categorizes logs by functional area.
    description: >-
      The WebLogic subsystem that generated the log message. Examples include Security,
      JTA (Java Transaction API), JDBC, JMS, EJB, HTTP, etc. This helps categorize
      log entries by functional area within the WebLogic server.
    example: example-subsystem
  - name: oracle.weblogic.machine_name
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      Physical or virtual machine name running WebLogic server. Identifies the node
      generated logs in clustered environments.
    description: >-
      The name of the physical or virtual machine where the WebLogic server instance
      is running. This is useful in clustered environments to identify which node
      generated the log entry.
    example: example-machine_name
  - name: oracle.weblogic.server_name
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      WebLogic server instance name that generated the log (AdminServer, ManagedServer1,
      etc.). Identifies source server.
    description: >-
      The name of the WebLogic server instance that generated the log message. In
      a WebLogic domain, this could be an Admin Server or a Managed Server name (e.g.,
      AdminServer, ManagedServer1, etc.).
    example: example-server_name
  - name: oracle.weblogic.thread_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      Thread identifier that generated the log message. Helps track which WebLogic
      thread pool handled the logged operation.
    description: >-
      The identifier of the thread that generated the log message. WebLogic uses thread
      pools to handle requests, and this field helps track which thread was responsible
      for the logged operation.
    example: example-thread_id
  - name: oracle.weblogic.diagnostic_context_id
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      Unique identifier for correlating related log messages across components in
      a request flow.
    description: >-
      A unique identifier used for correlating related log messages across different
      components and subsystems within a single request or transaction flow. This
      is essential for distributed tracing and debugging.
    example: example-diagnostic_context_id
  - name: oracle.weblogic.meta
    type: keyword
    level: custom
    short: >-
      Additional metadata or context information for the log entry. Contains supplementary
      details about the logged event.
    description: >-
