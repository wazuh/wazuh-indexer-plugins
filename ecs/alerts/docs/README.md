### Fields summary

For this stage, we are using all the fields of the ECS. No custom fields are used. As a result, we are using the default mapping of the ECS.

-   [ECS main mappings](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/v8.11.0/schemas/subsets/main.yml)

The generated template must match [this one](https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/v8.11.0/generated/elasticsearch/legacy/template.json).

The detail of the fields can be found in csv file [Alerts Fields](fields.csv).
