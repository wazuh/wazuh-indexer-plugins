# Compatibility

## Supported operating systems

We aim to support as many operating systems as [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/#operating-system-compatibility) does. Wazuh indexer should work on many Linux distributions, but we only test a handful. The following table lists the operating system versions that we currently support.

For 5.0.0 and above, we support the operating system versions and architectures included in the table below.
| Name         | Version      | Architecture    |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Red Hat      | 8, 9         | x86_64, aarch64 |
| Ubuntu       | 22.04, 24.04 | x86_64, aarch64 |
| Amazon Linux | 2, 2023      | x86_64, aarch64 |
| CentOS       | 8            | x86_64, aarch64 |

## OpenSearch

Currently, Wazuh indexer is using version `2.19.2` of OpenSearch.
