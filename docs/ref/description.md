# Description
The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This Wazuh central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities. The Wazuh indexer can be configured as a single-node or multi-node cluster, providing scalability and high availability.

The Wazuh indexer stores data as JSON documents. Each document correlates a set of keys, field names or properties, with their corresponding values which can be strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays of values, geolocations, or other types of data.

An index is a collection of documents that are related to each other. The documents stored in the Wazuh indexer are distributed across different containers known as shards. By distributing the documents across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, the Wazuh indexer can ensure redundancy. This protects your system against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.

Wazuh uses four different indices to store different event types:

| Index              |  Description        |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| wazuh‑alerts       | Stores alerts generated by the [Wazuh server](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html). These are created each time an event trips a rule with a high enough priority (this threshold is configurable).|
| wazuh‑archives     | Stores all events (archive data) received by the [Wazuh server](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html), whether or not they trip a rule.|
| wazuh‑monitoring   | Stores data related to the [Wazuh agent](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-agent.html) status over time. It is used by the web interface to represent when individual agents are or have been `Active`, `Disconnected`, or `Never connected`.|
| wazuh‑statistics   | Stores data related to the [Wazuh server](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html) performance. It is used by the web interface to represent the performance statistics.|
