# Description

The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This Wazuh central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities. The Wazuh indexer can be configured as a single-node or multi-node cluster, providing scalability and high availability.

The Wazuh indexer stores data as JSON documents. Each **document** correlates a set of keys, field names or properties, with their corresponding values which can be strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays of values, geolocations, or other types of data.

An **index** is a collection of documents that are related to each other. The documents stored in the Wazuh indexer are distributed across different containers known as **shards**. By distributing the documents across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, the Wazuh indexer can ensure redundancy. This protects your system against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.

The Wazuh indexer stores the data collected by the Wazuh agents in separate indices. Each index contains documents with specific inventory information. In this section, you can find a description of the information in each index.
