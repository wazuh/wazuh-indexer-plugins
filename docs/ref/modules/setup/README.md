# Setup

The `wazuh-indexer-setup` plugin is a module composing the Wazuh Indexer responsible for the initialization of the indices required by Wazuh to store all the data gathered and generated by other Central Components, such as the agents and the server (engine).

The Wazuh Indexer Setup Plugin in responsible for:
- Create the index templates, to define the mappings and settings of the indices.
- Create the initial indices. We distinguish between **stateful** and **stateless** indices. Stateful indices are unique and its data is update over time (agents' inventory), stateless indices are rotated and static (alerts).
- For stateless indices, it creates the indices aliases and lifecycle policies for rollover.
