# Architecture

## Design

The plugin implements the [ClusterPlugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/2.13.0/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/plugins/ClusterPlugin.java) interface in order to be able to hook into the nodeâ€™s lifecycle overriding the **onNodeStarted()** method. The logic for the creation of the index templates and the indices is encapsulated in the WazuhIndices class. The onNodeStarted method invoked the WazuhIndices::initialize() method, which handles everything.

By design, it was decided that the plugin will overwrite any index template it finds with the same name.

**TBD**: extend expected behavior of the plugin under different circumstances.

## JavaDoc

The plugin is documented using JavaDoc. You can compile the documentation using the Gradle task for that purpose. The generated JavaDoc is in the **build/docs** folder.

```bash
./gradlew javadoc
```

## Indices

Refer to [https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer/issues/344](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer/issues/344) for complete definitions of the indices. The indices inherit the settings and mappings defined in the [index templates](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer-plugins/tree/master/plugins/setup/src/main/resources).
