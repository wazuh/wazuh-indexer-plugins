## Commands API

Issue: [https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer-plugins/issues/69](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer-plugins/issues/69)

The Command Manager API is described formally in OpenAPI format. Check it out [here](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-indexer-plugins/blob/main/plugins/command-manager/openapi.yml).

> **Important**: The `action.name` attribute must always be provided before `action.args` in the JSON. Otherwise, the command is rejected. This is necessary for proper validation of the arguments, which depends on the command type, defined by `action.name`.

### fetch-config

The `fetch-config` command is used to order an agent to update its remote configuration.

Accepted values for `target.type` are `agent` and `group`. The `target.id` represents the agent's ID or group's name, respectively.

The command takes no arguments (`action.args`). Any provided argument is ignored.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "fetch-config",
        "args": {},
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "timeout": 100,
      "target": {
        "id": "d5b250c4-dfa1-4d94-827f-9f99210dbe6c",
        "type": "agent"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### set-group

The `set-group` command is used to change the groups of an agent.

Accepted values for `target.type` are `agent` and `group`. The `target.id` represents the agent's ID or group's name, respectively.

The command takes the `groups` argument, an array of strings depicting the **full list** of groups the agent belongs too. Any other value than an array of strings is rejected. Additional arguments are ignored.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "set-group",
        "args": {
          "groups": [
            "group_1",
            "group_2"
          ]
        },
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "timeout": 100,
      "target": {
        "id": "d5b250c4-dfa1-4d94-827f-9f99210dbe6c",
        "type": "agent"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### update

The `update` command is used to notify about new content being available. We usually refer to content to the CVE and Ruleset catalog.

Only accepted value for `target.type` is `server`. The `target.id` represents the server's module that is interested on the new content.

The command takes the `index` and `offset` arguments, strings depicting the index where the new content is and its version, respectively. Any other value than a string is rejected. Additional arguments are ignored.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "update",
        "args": {
          "index": "content-index",
          "offset": "1111"
        },
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "source": "Content Manager",
      "timeout": 100,
      "target": {
        "id": "vulnerability-detector",
        "type": "server"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### refresh

The `refresh` command is created when the Wazuh RBAC resources (users, roles, policies, ...) are modified.

This command serves to the Wazuh Server as a notification to update its local copy of these resources.

The expected values for `target.type` and `target.id` are `server` and `rbac`, respectively.

The command accepts an optional `index` argument, which must be an array of strings representing the RBAC indices that changed. Any other value than an array is strings is rejected. Additional arguments are ignored.

``` json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "refresh",
        "args": {
          "index": ["index-a", "index-b"], // Optional
        },
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "timeout": 100,
      "target": {
        "id": "rbac",
        "type": "server"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Commands expansion

Commands can be targeted to a group of agents, too. This is achieved by setting `group` as the target type and the name of the group as the target ID. For example:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "fetch-config",
        "args": {},
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "timeout": 100,
      "target": {
        "id": "group002",
        "type": "group"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The command is processed by the Command Manager and expanded. We refer to expansion as the generation of analogous commands targeting the individual agents that belong to that group. For example, if the `windows-group-A` group contains 10 agents, 10 commands will be generated, one for each of the agents. The target type and ID for these commands are set to `agent` and the ID of the agent, respectively.

```json
[
  {
    "command": {
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "target": {
        "type": "agent",
        "id": "agent82"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "fetch-config",
        "args": {},
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "timeout": 100,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  },
  {
    "command": {
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "target": {
        "type": "agent",
        "id": "agent21"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "fetch-config",
        "args": {},
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "timeout": 100,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  },
  {
    "command": {
      "source": "Users/Services",
      "user": "Management API",
      "target": {
        "type": "agent",
        "id": "agent28"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "fetch-config",
        "args": {},
        "version": "6.0.0"
      },
      "timeout": 100,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  }
]
```

## The Job Scheduler task

A periodic task performs an [updateByQuery](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/document-apis/update-by-query/) query to set the status of past due orders to "failed".
