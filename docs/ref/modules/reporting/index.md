# Wazuh Indexer Reporting plugin

The `wazuh-indexer-reporting` plugin provides functionality for generating customizable reports based on data stored in the Wazuh Indexer. Most of this data originates from the Wazuh Manager, which collects and analyzes security events from registered agents. The plugin supports both scheduled and on‑demand report generation. Reports can be delivered via email or downloaded on demand through the Wazuh Dashboard or the API. Users can create, read, update, and delete custom reports. Access to these actions is governed by the Wazuh Indexer’s role‑based access control (RBAC) permissions. This plugin is built on top of OpenSearch’s native [Reporting and Notifications plugins](https://docs.opensearch.org/3.3/reporting/report-dashboard-index/).
